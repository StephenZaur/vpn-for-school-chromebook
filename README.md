+  *You’ll find plenty of Chromebook VPNs claiming to be secure, private, and 100% free. In reality, many free VPNs have tiny data allowances, restricted servers, and slow speeds. The worst free Chromebook VPNs are even filled with hidden malware and trackers*

+  *To save you from risking your own Chromebook, I tested 50+ VPNs and ranked the best free VPNs for Chromebook in 2024. These VPNs are safe for most online activities — but if you regularly use a VPN, I suggest you invest in an affordable option like ExpressVPN*

+  *ExpressVPN has an easy-to-use Chrome extension and Android app, as well as unlimited data and bandwidth, military-grade security, and a global server network. You can try ExpressVPN on Chromebook risk-free as it’s backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you’re not satisfied, you can get a full refund with no questions asked*
